# Neanes Almouzios byzantine music font

Neanes Almouzios is an OpenType byzantine music font developed for [Neanes](https://neanes.github.io/neanes/), a free and open source scorewriter for notating Byzantine Chant.

Neanes Almouzios is compliant with [Standard Byzantine Music Font Layout (SBMuFL)](https://neanes.github.io/sbmufl/).

SBMuFL is a proposed standard for laying out a font that contains all the characters necessary to compose a score in modern Byzantine notation.

All characters would be mapped into the Private Use Area of the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane and characters would be positioned using features of modern font technologies such as mark-to-base positioning.

The font is based from [KA-Almouzios](https://github.com/t-bullock/KA-Almouzios) font.
